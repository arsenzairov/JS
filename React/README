The FontChooser component should allow the user to change the font weight (bold or normal) and font size of the text that it is displaying. Implement the React component in FontChooser.js as follows:

Initial rendering

When the component is initially rendered, the checkbox, buttons, and “fontSizeSpan” element should be hidden, as in the version we distributed.

The text that is set as the “text” property when the component is created should be displayed in the HTML page, as in the version we distributed.

If the “bold” property is set to “true,” the text should be displayed in bold; otherwise it should be displayed as normal. The version we distributed does not include this functionality, so you will need to implement this.

The text that is displayed should have a font size equal to the “size” property of the FontChooser component. The version we distributed does not include this functionality either.

Displaying the form elements

When the checkbox, buttons, and “fontSizeSpan” element are hidden and the user clicks on the text that the component is displaying in the HTML page, the checkbox, buttons, and “fontSizeSpan” element should appear to the left of the text.

When the checkbox, buttons, and “fontSizeSpan” element are shown and the user clicks on the text that the component is displaying in the HTML page, the checkbox, buttons, and “fontSizeSpan” element should disappear, i.e. become hidden again.

Checkbox functionality

If the React component’s “bold” property is set to “true” when the component is initially created, the checkbox should be selected/checked when it is first displayed. If the “bold” property is set to “false,” the checkbox should be unselected/unchecked.

If the checkbox is unselected/unchecked and then the user checks it, the text should immediately change to bold.

If the checkbox is selected/checked and then the user unchecks it, the text should immediately change to normal font weight.

Changing the font size

When the checkbox, buttons, and “fontSizeSpan” element are first displayed, the value in the “fontSizeSpan” should equal the React component’s “size” property, as in the version we distributed.

When the user clicks the “decreaseButton” (the one with the “—” sign on it), the value in the “fontSizeSpan” should decrement and the font size of the text should immediately decrease by one as well. However, the value in the “fontSizeSpan” may not be smaller than the React component’s “min” property. If the value in the “fontSizeSpan” equals the “min” property and the user clicks the “decreaseButton,” there should be no change.

Likewise, when the user clicks the “increaseButton” (the one with the “+” sign on it), the value in the “fontSizeSpan” should increment and the font size of the text should immediately increase by one as well. However, the value in the “fontSizeSpan” may not be larger than the React component’s “max” property. If the value in the “fontSizeSpan” equals the “max” property and the user clicks the “increaseButton,” there should be no change.

If the value of the “fontSizeSpan” equals the component’s “min” or “max” property, then its color should be red. If “fontSizeSpan” is between “min” and “max,” though, then its color should be black. The font size of the text in the “fontSizeSpan” should always be the browser’s default, i.e. you do not need to explicitly set it.

When the text in the “fontSizeSpan” is double-clicked, its value should become equal to the initial value set as the component’s initial “size” property, and the font size of the text that is displayed should immediately change to that value as well.

Error handling and default values

As you can see at the bottom of FontChooser.js, we have specified the default values for the props, in case they are not specified when the component is created.

However, your code should implement the following: 

If the “min” property has a value of 0 or a negative number, its value should be treated as 1 for limiting the smallest font size

If the “min” property is greater than the “max” property, then “min” and “max” should both be treated as the larger of the two, i.e. the “min” property

If the “size” property is less than the “min” property, the initial value should be treated as the same as the “min” property, or treated as 1 if “min” is 0 or negative

If the “size” property is greater than the “max” property, the initial value should be treated as the same as the “max” property

You do not need to address any other combination of values not specified above; these are the only ones that will be considered for grading.

Additionally, you do not need to handle the situation in which the “text” property is not specified when the component is created.

One more important note:

Please do not change the ID attributes of any of the HTML elements defined in FontChooser.render, as these IDs will be used by our tests during grading. You are free to add other attributes to the HTML elements, such as “class” or “value” attributes, and you’ll of course need to register callback functions for various events, but do not change the IDs.

Likewise, please do not change the names of the properties that are set in the <FontChooser> tag in chooser.html so that the tests can use them for grading your submission.

Helpful Hints

Review the past few lessons to see the syntax for registering callback functions for events using React.

You may need to modify some HTML element attributes that were not explicitly addressed in the lessons, in particular:

You can set whether an HTML element is displayed or not using its “hidden” attribute and setting it to “true” or “false” accordingly

You can set whether the checkbox appears as selected/checked or unselected/unchecked using its “checked” attribute and setting it to “true” or “false” accordingly

Your browser’s JavaScript console may show a warning about the checkbox having a “checked” attribute without an “onChange” handler. So be sure that when you modify the JSX for the component, the checkbox has a handler for “onChange” and not “onClick.”

In React, use “onDoubleClick” as the event name to set up the callback handler for double-clicking on an element

Also, be sure to use “red” and “black” as the colors for the text in the “fontSizeSpan” and not, for instance, “RED” or its hexadecimal value or anything else, since the grader will be checking for “red” and “black” specifically. Likewise, the same goes for using “bold” and “normal” for the font weight.
