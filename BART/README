	Project 2 from Harvard CS75
	http://cdn.cs75.net/2012/summer/projects/2/

Project Details:
	Create a website where users can look up real-time schedule 
	information (arrivals / departures) of BART train routes.

Instructions:
	Users pick a route from the drop down menu, a list of stations will show.
	Users pick a station, the real-time arrivals/departures appear on the page.
	Also, the route is drawn in a google map and users can click on the map
	marker of a station & see real-time departure times pop-up on the map.
	By default, route #1 is displayed in the Google map on first page load.
	The bart.sql file has all the tables pre-filled with data from the BART API.

Languages: 
	HTML - CSS - PHP - SQL - Javascript

3rd Party Tools: 
	- BART API 
	- Google Maps API


Needed Improvements:
	- BART API calls are sometimes slow
