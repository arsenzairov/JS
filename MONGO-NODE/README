In this assignment you will implement four Web APIs using Node and Express to handle the HTTP requests and responses, and Mongoose to handle the interaction with the MongoDB database.

The specifications of the APIs are provided below. We recommend that you attempt them in the order in which they are described. Note that in all but the first instance, your code will need to construct the JSON object that is sent back in the response, as opposed to just sending back the data that comes out of MongoDB.

/findToy

Parameters:

id: >the ID of the Toy to find

Example usage: /findToy?id=1234

Description:

This API finds and returns the Toy in the “toys” collection with the ID that matches the id> parameter. It should return the entire Toy document/object, including all properties that are stored in the database.

If the id> parameter is unspecified, or if there is no Toy that has a matching ID, this API should return an empty object.

/findAnimals

Parameters:

species: >the species of the Animals to find

trait: >one of the traits of the Animals to find

gender: >the gender of the Animals to find

Example usage: /findAnimals?species=Dog&trait=loyal&gender=female

Description:

This API finds all Animals in the “animals” collection that have a species and gender that match the species> and gender> parameters, respectively, and for which one of the Animal’s traits matches the trait> parameter. All matches should be complete matches, not partial matches using regular expressions, for instance.

The return value is an array of objects representing each Animal, but the object must only> include the Animal’s name, species, breed, gender, and age.

If the species>, trait>, or gender> parameter is unspecified, it should be ignored in the search, i.e. the API should consider Animals regardless of their values for the unspecified parameter(s)

However, if the species>, trait>, and gender> parameters are all unspecified, then the API should return an empty object.

Likewise, if there are no Animals that match all of the specified parameters, the API should return an empty object.

Examples: Consider the following collection of Animals:

name

species

Breed

gender

age

traits

>“Cooper”

>“Dog”

>“Catahoula”

>“male”

>11

>[“crazy”, “funny”]

>“Lola”

>“Dog”

>“Beagle”

>“female”

>5

>[“loyal”, “friendly”]

>“Garfield”

>“Cat”

>“Tabby”

>“male”

>39

>[“lazy”, “hungry”]

>“Felix”

>“Cat”

>“Tuxedo”

>“male”

>98

>[“funny”, “loyal”]

Example #1

Request: /findAnimals?species=Dog&trait=loyal&gender=female

Response: [{"name":"Lola","species":"Dog","breed":"Beagle","gender":"female","age":5}]

Example #2

Request: /findAnimals?trait=funny

Response: [{"name":"Cooper","species":"Dog","breed":"Catahoula","gender":"male","age":11},{"name":"Felix","species":"Cat","breed":"Tuxedo","gender":"male","age":98}]

/animalsYoungerThan

Parameters:

age: >the maximum age (exclusive) of the Animals to find

Example usage: /animalsYoungerThan?age=12

Description:

This API finds all Animals in the “animals” collection that have an age that is less than (but not equal to!) the age> parameter.

The return value is an object that has two properties:

“count”: the number of Animals whose age is less than the age> parameter.

“names”: an array containing the names of the Animals whose age is less than the age> parameter (these can be arranged in any order in the array)

If there are no Animals that have an age less than the age> parameter, then the API should return an object that has a “count” property set to 0, but no “names” property

If the age> parameter is unspecified or non-numeric, then the API should return an empty object

/calculatePrice

Parameters:

id[i]: >the ID of the i>th Toy to include in the calculation

qty[i]: >the quantity of the i>th Toy to include in the calculation

Example usage: /calculatePrice?id[0]=123&qty[0]=2&id[1]=456&qty[1]=3

Description:

This API calculates the total price of purchasing the specified quantities of the Toys with the corresponding IDs, using the Toys’ price from the database.

For each i, >this API finds the Toy with the ID equal to the id[i]> parameter and determines the subtotal for that Toy by multiplying its price by the specified quantity qty[i]>. It then uses the subtotals for all Toys to calculate the total price.

The return value is an object that has two properties:

“totalPrice”: the calculated total for all Toys.

“items”: an array containing objects that hold information about the Toys that are included; for each Toy, there should be an object with these three properties:

“item”: the Toy’s ID, as specified in the query

“qty”: the quantity of the Toy, as specified in the query

“subtotal”: the Toy’s price multiplied by the quantity

If an id> parameter does not correspond to the ID of a Toy in the database, then that ID and the corresponding quantity should be ignored

If a qty> parameter is less than one or non-numeric, then it and the corresponding id> parameter should be ignored

If the same id> parameter is specified more than once, then the total quantity for that Toy should be considered as the sum of all corresponding qty> parameters. However, if any such qty> parameter is less than one or non-numeric, that parameter should be ignored.

If all id>/qty> parameters are to be ignored because of the above, then the API should return an object with “totalPrice” set to 0 and “items” set to an empty array

The API should return an empty object if:

There are no query parameters specified in the request

The number of id> parameters does not match the number of qty> parameters

Examples: Consider the following collection of Toys:

ID

Name

Price

>“123”

>“Dog chew toy”

>10.99

>“456”

>“Dog pillow”

>25.99

Example #1

Request: /calculatePrice?id[0]=123&qty[0]=2&id[1]=456&qty[1]=3

Response: {"items":[{"item":"123","qty":"2","subtotal":21.98},{"item":"456","qty":"3","subtotal":77.97}],"totalPrice":99.95}

Example #2

Request: /calculatePrice?id[0]=123&qty[0]=1&id[1]=xxxx&qty[1]=3

Response: {"items":[{"item":"123","qty":"1","subtotal":10.99}],> "totalPrice":10.99}

Example #3

Request: /calculatePrice?id[0]=abc&qty[0]=1&id[1]=456&qty[1]=dog

Response: {"items":[],"totalPrice":0}

What about…?

You may encounter other cases that are not addressed in this document. You may handle those cases in any manner you choose (or ignore them entirely!) since they will not be considered for grading in this assignment.

One more important note:

As mentioned above, please do not change the Schema definitions in Animal.js or Toy.js, as these will be used by the automatic grader. You may, however, change the host/port/database configuration, since the grader will replace these with its own settings.

Helpful Hints

Review the past few lessons to see the syntax for setting up routes in your Express app and for using Mongoose to perform queries on your MongoDB database.

If you start your Node Express app and immediately see an error message such as:

MongoError: failed to connect to server [localhost:27017] on first connect [MongoError: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:27017]

This means that either your MongoDB database is not running or that you have specified the incorrect host/port combination.

For the /animalsYoungerThan API, you can do a “less than” search by specifying a query object in the form {field:{$lt:value}}. See https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/query/lt/ for more information.

For the /calculatePrice API, note that a URL query string such as 

?id[0]=123&qty[0]=2&id[1]=456&qty[1]=3

will result in the HTTP Request object’s “query” property having the properties “id” and “qty”, both of which are arrays. You can then use those arrays to find the IDs and quantities that you need. You may want to consider using some of the ES6 data structures we saw last week, such as Maps and Sets, to relate IDs to their corresponding quantities.

Last, and perhaps most importantly, for the /calculatePrice API, try to avoid performing multiple queries on one request, e.g. calling Toy.find in a loop for each ID, but rather figure out how to construct a single query object that only calls Toy.find once. Since the callback method that is invoked as a result of the query is asynchronous, you may get unexpected results if you try to use Toy.find in a loop.
